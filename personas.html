She got a scholarship to study in Italy and she lived there for 7 years, and there is were she met her husband. During her studies, she learned about intelligent houses and became fascinated with the concept. She likes to learn about new technology that will save her time, and would be very useful to get something that would help her and her husband to take care of their little kids. Although she likes technology, it is still quite difficult to understand it for her. So she needs something that would help her spare time, but also easy to use</p>
